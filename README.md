# **Classification on Diabetes**

#### Introduction

It is increasingly recognized that the management of hyperglycemia in the hospitalized patient has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. This recognition has led to the development of formalized protocols in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting with rigorous glucose targets in many institutions. However, the same cannot be said for most non-ICU inpatient admissions. Rather, anecdotal evidence suggests that inpatient management is arbitrary and often leads to either no treatment at all or wide fluctuations in glucose when traditional management strategies are employed. In this project and according to the data set, we will use supervised machine learning techniques, particularly, classification to predict the outcome of a diabetic patient based on set of features which are thought to be very important and which are likely able to explain the variability in disease outcome in different patients.

#### Approach

In this project, we are going to propose a set of questions which tailor or guide the overall data analysis approach that will be taken in order to better understand the data and gain more insights from it to instruct future decisions. There are two medically important predictions to be made which most likely are important for both diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes in different patients.

#### Questions

1. Is the patient diabetic or not based on a set of important factors such as &quot;Serum Glucose level&quot;, &quot;number of diagnoses&quot;, Type of primary diagnosis and secondary diagnoses, history of diabetes related medications, insulin intake and laboratory related procedures?
2. Will the patient be readmitted to the hospital again? and If so, what is the expected relapse or readmission of the patient given his/her current representation or state of health?

#### Data Description:

The data that will be collected from ([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#))

#### End User Benefits

1. Early prediction of diabetes in susceptible patients is very important equally for clinicians in diagnosing the disease and for patients to be guided on their treatment plan and government to be able to evaluate and predict the cost on treatments in advance and set up plans and strategies to support patients and their families during the treatment.
2. Early prediction of re-admission is very important not only to patients or clinicians but also to the hospitals themselves, to proactively respond and prepare beds and equipment to treat those patients.
